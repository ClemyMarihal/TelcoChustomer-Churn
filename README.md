Project Overview
The project aims to analyze and predict customer churn based on historical customer data. The dataset contains information about customers' demographics, account details, and their interaction with the telecommunications company. The primary objective is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer will churn or not.

Key steps in this project:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature Engineering
Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
Model Evaluation and Tuning
Data Description
The dataset used for this project contains several features, including:
